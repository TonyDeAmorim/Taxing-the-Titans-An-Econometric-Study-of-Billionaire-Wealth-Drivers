## Data sets presentation
For this project we decided to center our work on a dataset made by the The Peterson Institute for International Economics. This institute is an "independent non-profit, non-partisan research organization dedicated to strengthening prosperity and human welfare in the global economy through expert analysis and practical policy solutions". The dataset was made by the thinktank in 2016 and describes more than billionaires over 23 variables such as citizenship, origin of wealth and net worth. Every source is used in the research paper to find the data is available in the raw dataset, which can be downloaded freely here : https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/origins-superrich-billionaire-characteristics-database   

As we want to focus our research on the impact of taxation on billionaires' behaviors, we wanted to use data about wealth taxation in every country. However, tax rates are hard to find and are often unavailable in countries where billionaires live (they surprisingly avoid countries with high taxation !). To remediate to this issue, we decide to use the ratio of taxation as a % of total revenue for the governement. This data captures the idea that the more important tax revenue is for a country's budget, the more likely it is that this country applies high level of taxation. Following this idea, we use the freely accessible dataset of the world bank "Tax revenue (% of GDP)" available here : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS

We still wanted to have a more precise idea of real taxation so we also decided to work on the "Taxes on income, profits and capital gains (% of revenue)" dataset of the world bank, even if a lot of countries are missing (especialy for old values). The data set is available here : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.YPKG.RV.ZS

To complete our study and have a better understanding of the different trends in the billionaires' world, we use a custom dataset from the IMF data explorer to select several macroeconomics variables such as :
- GDP growth
- FDI
- Formation brut de capital net
- Director rate

The IMF data explorer is usable following this link : https://data.imf.org/en/Data-Explorer
